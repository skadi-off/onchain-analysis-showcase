# Description

Our clustering workflow identifies groups of blockchain addresses that demonstrate coordinated or structurally similar behavior. The methodology is built around several abstract stages, without disclosing the underlying logic or criteria.

**- Data Preparation.**  
We collect and normalize multi-chain activity data, forming a consistent dataset for analysis.

**- Behavioral Profiling.**  
Each address is converted into a high-level behavioral profile that captures interaction patterns and activity structure. No specific metrics are exposed.

**- Relationship Modeling.**  
We build a generalized connection graph that reflects how addresses relate to each other across multiple dimensions. The way relationships are weighted is not disclosed.

**- Cluster Formation.**  
Addresses are grouped into clusters using a layered approach that considers behavior, structure, and contextual signals — without revealing how decisions are made.

**- Multi-Step Validation.**  
Clusters are cross-validated through several abstract checks to ensure internal consistency and reduce noise. Validation logic remains proprietary.

**- Analyst Review.**  
A final manual review refines cluster boundaries and ensures high precision.

**- Reporting.**  
Validated clusters are exported into clean tables that show final groupings without exposing any internal methodology.
