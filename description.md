# Description

Based on the specifics of protocol activity, we apply different sets of criteria for cluster formation.



For example:

* Max volume per day (max\_volume\_per\_day)
* Max amount of single tx (min\_single\_tx\_amount)
* Date of max volume per day (day\_of\_max\_volume)
* First transaction for the $STG token (first\_$STG\_tx)
* Total amount of txs (tx\_count)
* First interaction with L0 smart-contract (L0\_fist\_tx\_date)
* Last interaction with L0 smart-contract (L0\_last\_tx\_date)
* Total volume of bridged funds (total\_volume)
* Amount of source chains (source\_chain\_count)
* Amount of destination chains (destination\_chain\_count)
* Amount of interactions with L0 smart-contracts (L0\_contracts\_interacted\_count)
* First transaction in TOP-7 EVM Blockchains (top\_evm\_first\_tx)
* Interaction with centralized exchanges (CEX)
* Common smart-contracts of the protocols (well-known protocols shows first)



For each specific group of wallets, we use different combinations of these criteria.
